### Disabled due to configuration migrated to pyproject.toml ###

# We are using a metadata file to describe code dependencies , pyproject.toml
# Use the extra_requirements option in that file (see Packages)
# As such, the options below are redundant and now commented out

# Build documentation in the "docs/" directory with Sphinx
#sphinx:
#   configuration: docs/conf.py

# Optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF and ePub
# formats:
#    - pdf
